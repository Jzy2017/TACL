## Overview
![avatar](Overview.PNG)

## Prerequisites
- Linux or macOS
- Python 3
- CPU or NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN

## Installation
Type the command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Download
Download the pre-trained model and put it in _./checkpoints_
- [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VEx7CR0iFJNesCS_Ci98CEAaFhhzsela/view?usp=sharing)
- [Baidu Yun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1WZ79-GbJEoJkNDMrgVBtVw) \
code:
​```
YSZD
​```

## Quick Run
Put the images you want to process in the _./datasets_ folder. \
To test the pre-trained models for Underwater Enhancement on your own images, run
```bash
python test.py --dataroot ./datasets/[YOUR-DATASETS] --name underwater --model cycle_gan
```
Results will be shown in _results_ folder.

## Train Backbone
- First, you need to train a base backbone:
```bash
python train.py --dataroot ./datasets/[YOUR-DATASETS] --name chinamm_train --model cycle_gan
```

## Training TAF
- Second, you need to train a TAF module (here we adopt SSD): \
  * Download an Underwater Detection Dataset (**[Chinamm](https://rwenqi.github.io/chinaMM2019uw/)**).
  * Run this to make Chinamm in VOC format:
  ```bash
  python makeTXT.py
  ```
  * Use the trained backbone to enhance JPEGImages of chinamm.
  * cd ./ssd.pytorch-master

- Download the fc-reduced [VGG-16](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) PyTorch base network weights at:              https://s3.amazonaws.com/amdegroot-models/vgg16_reducedfc.pth
- By default, we assume you have downloaded the file in the `ssd.pytorch/weights` dir:

```Shell
mkdir weights
cd weights
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/amdegroot-models/vgg16_reducedfc.pth
```

- To train SSD using the train script simply specify the parameters listed in `train.py` as a flag or manually change them.

```Shell
python train.py
```

- Note:
  * For training, an NVIDIA GPU is strongly recommended for speed.
  * For instructions on Visdom usage/installation, see the <a href='#installation'>Installation</a> section.
  * You can pick-up training from a checkpoint by specifying the path as one of the training parameters (again, see `train.py` for options)

- Evaluation
To evaluate a trained network:

```Shell
python eval.py
```

You can specify the parameters listed in the `eval.py` file by flagging them or manually changing them.  

## Training
cd ./ssd.pytorch-master \
Run
```Shell
python trainall.py
```
- Test final version:
```Shell
python visual.py
```
